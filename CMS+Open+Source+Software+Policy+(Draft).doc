<strong>This draft is (almost) ready for publication. Links needs verificat=
ion by OC.</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has been an active =
supporter of and has utilized the <a href=3D"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/=
Free_and_open-source_software" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Ope=
n Source Software (OSS)</a>&nbsp;on several IT projects for its mission-cri=
tical programs. Several CMS business units and offices have been actively r=
eleasing OSS as part of IT modernization projects. CMS has many active open=
 source communities,&nbsp;such as the BlueButton, <a href=3D"http://Healthc=
are.gov" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Healthcare.gov</a> StyleG=
uide, and the MMIS Provider screening module on&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://git=
hub.com/cmsgov" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Github</a>. CMS ha=
s embraced the OSS for our development projects and is looking forward to r=
eleasing software codes to the open source community to promote its reuse. =
This policy will help CMS achieve the goals outlined in the <a href=3D"http=
s://code.gov/#/policy-guide/policy/introduction" class=3D"external-link" re=
l=3D"nofollow">OMB directive</a> for Federal agencies.</p>
<p><strong>OSS Consideration &amp; Applicability</strong></p>
<p>This policy assumes that before OSS development, and in accordance with =
the <a href=3D"https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/docs/compliance/procurement"=
 class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">three-step software solution anal=
ysis</a>, the project team has conducted market research and analyzed comme=
rcial and other open source alternatives that may meet their business need.=
 This OSS policy applies when the project team ventures into custom code de=
velopment and chooses the project code as a candidate for OSS.&nbsp; The pr=
oject teams must&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Soft=
ware-FAQ/" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">verify if they may rele=
ase</a> the source code that has been developed using Government funds.</p>
<p><strong>Government Data Rights</strong></p>
<p>The CMS Office of the Acquisition and Grants Management (OAGM) has an es=
tablished IT procurement procedure that sets the <a href=3D"https://www.acq=
uisition.gov/far/html/Subpart%2027_4.html" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"n=
ofollow">rights to the custom-developed code</a>, including at a minimum, r=
ights to Government-wide reuse and rights to modify the code.&nbsp; CMS con=
tractors who develop software for CMS business use are covered by the procu=
rement clauses that provide the Copyright of the CMS-funded custom designed=
 software to CMS and prohibits the contractors from reselling it to other F=
ederal Government agencies. Such custom produced software for CMS can be ma=
de freely available to other Government agencies. Due to a variety of IT an=
d non-IT contracts that CMS may enter into, it is the project team=E2=80=99=
s responsibility to perform all due diligence for their specific contract i=
n consultation with the OAGM. The project team shall review Section 21: =E2=
=80=9CLogistic Considerations=E2=80=9D, and section 5.27: =E2=80=9CContract=
or Data Requirements=E2=80=9D of OAGM Acquisition Plan Guide before releasi=
ng the code as OSS. CMS requires all development contractors to maintain th=
e source code and documentation in a CMS-approved and accessible version co=
ntrol system. CMS has created&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://www.cms.gov/Research-=
Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/index.html" clas=
s=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">eXpedited LifeCycle (XLC) process fram=
ework</a> for the development teams to identify, track and version control =
all software artifacts. The XLC artifacts are deliverables to CMS that prov=
ides a set of documentation and source code that might be considered for Go=
vernment-wide reuse of the custom software.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CMS OSS Pilot Program</strong></p>
<p>As outlined in the requirements of the <a href=3D"https://code.gov/#/pol=
icy-guide/policy/introduction" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Fed=
eral Source Code Policy</a>, CMS has already identified the <a href=3D"http=
s://qpp.cms.gov/" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Quality Payment =
Program (QPP)</a> as CMS=E2=80=99 OSS pilot program. The QPP project team h=
as already released <a href=3D"https://github.com/CMSgov/qpp-conversion-too=
l" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">a tool for file conversion</a> =
as OSS during the calendar year 2017. The QPP conversion tool allows XML to=
 JSON file conversion for consumption by the Submissions API.&nbsp; The pro=
ject team believes that it will let any provider or entity that creates QPP=
 files to have access to the tool outside of the context of QPP submissions=
 and that can be extended to other file formats.</p>
<p>CMS intends to release the additional OSS as the QPP program matures.</p=
>
<p><strong>OSS Implementation &amp; Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p>Any CMS project team that wishes to publish their code as OSS must set a=
 clear expectation of their level of involvement in sustaining that project=
. The project team shall define an OSS release process that begins with a d=
etermination of if the intended software can indeed be released as OSS, con=
sidering any security and other CMS policy restrictions. Depending on the n=
ature of the OSS and associated licensing model, the project team shall ade=
quately allocate resources to be able to sustain and flourish the project i=
n the open source community.</p>
<p>The project team shall utilize an existing public-facing website to conv=
ey information about the project and provide a link to the project=E2=80=99=
s GitHub repository. The project team <span style=3D"color: rgb(0,51,102);"=
>should implement tools to support the community around an open source proj=
ect, such </span>as<span style=3D"color: rgb(255,0,0);">&nbsp;</span>mailin=
g lists, message forums, a version control, wiki, and tracking mechanisms, =
such as Kanban boards to track issues and bugs on the GitHub repository.</p=
>
<p>For every iteration of the code release, the project team must ensure th=
at the software code is adequately peer reviewed and is free of security vu=
lnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors. Until the software=
&nbsp;code is adequately reviewed, it should <span style=3D"color: rgb(0,51=
,102);">be either 1)</span> maintained in an internal code repository that =
replicates the intended public repository <span style=3D"color: rgb(0,51,10=
2);">or 2) checked by publicly available services providing the same functi=
ons on all code check-ins to the public source code repository</span>. The =
software should also contain automated unit tests, build scripts and should=
 be checked for software vulnerabilities, code quality and code coverage us=
ing available standard CMS tools. The code should be built with CMS=E2=80=
=99s standard continuous integration (CI) server. The project team should i=
nclude ample documentation with the software&nbsp;code for increased adopti=
on and modification by the community. The documentation should provide the =
information on project=E2=80=99s mission, philosophy, goal, design, decisio=
n-making process, product roadmap and instructions on how to submit issues,=
 feature requests and how to contribute towards a fix or enhancements. The =
documentation should be accessible to the Open Source community.</p>
<p>The CMS project teams should follow or adopt a decentralized governance =
model to ensure the success of the OSS as the software matures in the Open =
Source community. The governance model should define the team constituents,=
 their decision-making authority and their roles to support the project in =
the open source community. For sustaining the project, the team, at a minim=
um, should define and staff the <a href=3D"https://www.apache.org/foundatio=
n/how-it-works.html#roles" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">roles</=
a> for active user engagement, product roadmap development, and accepting n=
ew contributions via pull-requests. These resources shall be staffed in add=
ition to existing project team members. The project team is expected to tak=
e on the additional responsibility of encouraging meaningful engagement in =
the project by identifying and promoting active contributors to committer s=
tatus based on the quality and quantity of code contributions and involveme=
nt in day-to-day discussions, as is the case in a <a href=3D"https://www.ap=
ache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy" class=3D"external-link" =
rel=3D"nofollow">meritocracy based system</a>.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>CMS' Public OSS Repository</strong></p>
<p>The CMS project teams shall utilize the <a href=3D"https://github.com/CM=
Sgov" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">official CMS GitHub organiza=
tion account</a> to make their source code available to the open source com=
munity and for Government-Wide use. The project teams shall use a consisten=
t naming convention and a prefix for their code repositories that allows fo=
r easy identification on&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://GitHub.com/CMSGov" class=3D=
"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">GitHub</a>. The project teams shall also p=
rovide updates to the CMS=E2=80=99s official <a href=3D"https://confluence.=
cms.gov/provide-link-here" rel=3D"nofollow">enterprise code inventory</a>, =
update the CMS public website - the <a href=3D"https://confluence.cms.gov/J=
onBooth%20is%20developing" rel=3D"nofollow"><span class=3D"inline-comment-m=
arker" data-ref=3D"c04ece61-7173-44b7-9995-4997325a5384">OSS landing page</=
span></a> and, update the CMS enterprise code repository at <a href=3D"http=
s://www.code.gov/" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Code.gov</a>&nb=
sp;to encourage discovery and dissemination of the software.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>License</strong></p>
<p>There is a wide variety of OSS licensing models available, and the CMS p=
roject teams are required to research and choose a licensing model that is =
suitable for their project. <span style=3D"color: rgb(255,0,0);"><span styl=
e=3D"color: rgb(0,51,102);">Several CMS projects have preferred to dedicate=
 their work in the</span><span style=3D"color: rgb(0,0,255);"> <a href=3D"h=

/a></span>. </span>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=3D"https://opensource.org/license=
s" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Open Source Initiative</a> main=
tains a <a href=3D"https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical" class=3D"e=
xternal-link" rel=3D"nofollow">list of licenses</a> that the project team m=
ay <span style=3D"color: rgb(0,51,102);">optionally</span> use. The section=
&nbsp;<a href=3D"http://wiki.civiccommons.org/Choosing_a_License" class=3D"=
external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">Choosing a License</a>&nbsp;at the Civic Co=
mmons wiki may also be a useful resource that provides additional help for =
selection of an appropriate license. The project team should consider the d=
ifference between =E2=80=9Cpermissive=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Cnon-permissive=
=E2=80=9D licenses, warranty/guarantee limitations, attribution, and tradem=
ark/IP protections and its impact on the choice of license.</p>
<p>Once an appropriate license is chosen for the project, the full license =
text should be included in the =E2=80=98license=E2=80=99 file of the distri=
bution bundle. Each source code must have a notice at the top to name CMS, =
or an organization designated explicitly by CMS as the copyright and licens=
e holder of the source code and provide a link to the full text of the lice=
nse.</p>
<p>The project team must perform appropriate due diligence before the publi=
cation of their source code, primarily when the project team uses or import=
s any freely available open source products and libraries to build their so=
ftware that is released as OSS. The original license of all referenced code=
 and libraries must be included with the distribution of the source, accord=
ing to the terms of the original license. The CMS Technical Reference Archi=
tecture (TRA) supplement =E2=80=9CDevelopment and Application Services=E2=
=80=9D provides additional guidelines for the CMS project team that wish to=
 use the OSS libraries and packaged OSS for their internal consumption or d=
evelopment of new and custom software that is not intended for the publicat=
ion in the OSS community.</p>
<p><s><strong>Planning for</strong></s> Transition and End of Life (EOL) co=
nsiderations</p>
<p>A CMS OSS project may be retired due to inactivity, or due to a compelli=
ng business need, or the project transitioned to other organizations. When =
ending support, projects should send a notification to existing end users, =
informing them of CMS=E2=80=99s decision to terminate support of the OSS.</=
p>
<p><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></p>
<p>CMS would like to thank General Services Administration (GSA)=E2=80=99s =
18F team, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Office o=
f Management and Budget (OMB) for their inspirational work in the use of OS=
S in the Federal Government.</p>
<p><strong>Future changes</strong></p>
<p>This CMS policy is a living document, and any changes to this policy in =
the future would be handled via <a href=3D"https://github.com/18f/open-sour=
